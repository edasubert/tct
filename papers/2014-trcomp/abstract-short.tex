Our project is aimed at development of an online infrastructure for providing translation to social media and gathering relevant training data to support machine translation of such content. Social networks have gained tremendous popularity and have successfully replaced many established means of communication. However there still remains obstacle of spoken languages. While machine translation is capable on well-written texts it still is near to unusable on noisy badly-written messages on social networks. We endeavour to solve this inadequacy.
