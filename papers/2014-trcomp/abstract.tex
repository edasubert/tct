\section{Introduction}

This paper presents Twitter Crowd Translation (TCT), our project aimed at
development of an online infrastructure serving two
purposes:
(1) providing online translation to social media and (2)
gathering relevant training data to support machine translation of such content.
We focus on Twitter and the open-source machine translation toolkit
Moses. Our project heavily relies on unpaid voluntary work.

In \Sref{motiv}, we provide the motivation for both goals of our work.
% Tohle zatim nemame, ale v plnem clanku by to byt melo:
%\Sref{chall} briefly lists the challenges specific to machine translation of
%social media, focusing more on the technical aspects than on the inherent
%linguistic characteristics concerning style, register etc.
\Sref{design} describes the overall design of our tool in terms of
\equo{social engineering} and \Sref{implementation} complements it by the
technical aspects.

% maintenance of corpora for machine translation without the need of hiring
% translators while using the power of crowd instead. The application is designed
% to be able to work with any source phrases; however we specialize for
% translation of tweets from popular social network Twitter.

%The aim of our project is to create and maintain corpora for machine
%translation without the need of hiring expensive translators while using the
%power of crowd instead. We achieve this with online interface which allows
%addition of new phrases to corpus their translation as well as evaluation of
%the best translation. Aside from creating the corpus application offers
%language practice and access to foreign content to users.

\section{Motivation}
\label{motiv}

Social networks have gained tremendous popularity and 
have successfully replaced many established means of communication. 
While geographical location of the users has little to no impact on 
communication, obstacle of \emph{spoken languages} remains.

For stable and long-lasting content, the problem is less severe:
services such as the Wikipedia have shown that
volunteers are able to provide translations into many languages. 
Machine translation is usually easy to train and apply on such
content.

On the other hand, social networks are used in a streaming fashion, Twitter
being the most prominent example. Anybody can contribute message, 
which is forwarded to a number of followers whose feeds are flooded 
with messages from sources they select. Given the constant flow
of new information, the expiration of single message is short.

Providing translation to \equo{streaming networks} is much more challenging.
The input is much noisier, significantly reducing MT output quality. 

The social motivation of our project is to break the language
barrier for streaming social networks. The technological motivation is to
advance MT quality by collecting more data.
What Wikipedia and on-line MT services gained for stable content,
we would like to acquire for streaming networks and similar content.

\section{Design of TCT}
\label{design}

We see two main reasons for people to 
contribute to such community project: sharing the information 
(\equo{What is useful for me, it may be useful for others.}), 
and self-promotion
(\equo{I will gain good reputation by contributing well received translations.}).
We designed our project in accordance to these findings.

TCT should be as thin layer as possible, to cause 
minimal disruption. The consequence is
that the majority of users stay within their platform -- Twitter in this
case.

To better explain the processes of TCT we assign users roles: 
\textbf{Author}, \textbf{Selector}, \textbf{Translator}, \textbf{Judge} 
and \textbf{Recipient}.

\Fref{schema} summarizes the work cycle: a tweet in a foreign language is
tweeted by \textbf{Author} and observed by a \textbf{Selector}. 
The \textbf{Selector} does not fully understand the message 
and submits it for translation to the language of his choice. 
Our TCT server collects this request and
forwards it to human and machine \textbf{Translators}. Translations 
are then collected and \textbf{Judges} evaluate their quality. The best
translation is tweeted to \textbf{Selector} and other \textbf{Recipients} 
by our server. 
The same user can takes several roles in the process.

We think that each of the user groups profits from using TCT. 
\textbf{Author} gains bigger audience. 
\textbf{Selector} achieves full understanding of tweet.
\textbf{Translator} and \textbf{Judge} practice their language skills 
and \textbf{Translator} is placed in TCT hall of fame.
Finally \textbf{Recipient} gains greater understandable content.

\section{Technical Aspects of TCT}
\label{implementation}
It is important for us to let users interact with TCT through their platform.
Therefore \textbf{Selector} submits message as tweet marked with hashtag 
\hashtag{tctrq} and TCT uses Twitter REST API to search twitter feed
for such tweets.

Once tweets are collected \textbf{Translators} are notified via e-mail
to which they respond with translation and TCT collects received e-mails.

\textbf{Judges} are the only group that is required to contribute via 
TCT website and evaluate the quality of translations by blinded one to one 
comparison. 

Interesting feature is no password registration. 
Translators are only group required to register but their interaction
is strictly e-mail based. 
Necessary settings are accessed by expiring link sent via e-mail on request.
