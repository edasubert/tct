\section{Introduction}
The aim of our project is to develop online application for creation and
maintenance of corpora for machine translation without the need of hiring
translators while using the power of crowd instead. The application is designed
to be able to work with any source phrases; however we specialize for
translation of tweets from popular social network Twitter.

%The aim of our project is to create and maintain corpora for machine
%translation without the need of hiring expensive translators while using the
%power of crowd instead. We achieve this with online interface which allows
%addition of new phrases to corpus their translation as well as evaluation of
%the best translation. Aside from creating the corpus application offers
%language practice and access to foreign content to users.

\section{Motivation}
There are many successful crowd driven projects online; most notably Wikipedia
or its sister project Wiktionary. Second example is much more important for our
project since it shows that users all over the world are eager to translate in
various languages. (As of \today{ }site claims to have 3,766,260 entries with
English definitions from over 1400 languages.) This approach could also improve
role of machine translation in daily communication since it is designed to let
users translate this type of phrases.

\section{Our Proposal}
In general there are three steps in work cycle of such application. Addition of
new phrases their translation and finally their evaluation. Our solution to
first step is to use social network Twitter. Application periodically scans the
network for hashtag \hashtag{tctrq} and adds content of such tweets to database.
Each tweet is required to contain another hashtag with the target language of
translation. Twitter uses its own system to determine language of each tweet and
our application uses this information. 

Second step the translation takes place immediately thereafter. Each of
registered translators capable of translation between source and target language
is notified via e-mail and submits translation as a reply e-mail. These replies
are periodically collected and added to database. At this point machine
translation from Moses is added to compete with human translators. 

Third step of work cycle the evaluation is the only step that requires user to
come to our website and use simple interface to vote between two translations.
Voting is of course blinded. After gaining high enough score the translation is
posted back to Twitter as a response to request and thus completing the cycle.

\section{Our solution}
The application is developed with the CakePHP framework. For all e-mail
communication we use associated Gmail account through IMAP protocol. The Twitter
integration is done with Simple PHP Wrapper for Twitter through REST API.
